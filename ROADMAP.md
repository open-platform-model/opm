## Research & Open Questions

Areas we're actively exploring:

### Workflow Strategy

- Should OPM define its own pipeline system or standardize integration with existing CI/CD tools?
- Should there be separate standards for CI/CD pipelines vs. application lifecycle operations?

### Dependency Management

- How to handle element dependencies across modules?
- Strategy for deprecating elements while maintaining backward compatibility
- Versioning strategy for elements vs. modules

### Platform Integration

- Design for runtime queries to pull environment-specific metadata
- How should platform teams curate and enforce module catalogs?
- Integration patterns with service meshes, observability platforms

### Element Evolution

- How to add new elements when the project is in wide use?
- Migration paths for breaking changes

### Element Discovery & Filtering

- Label-based element filtering and query system
- Element discovery by category, platform, maturity, compliance requirements
- Dynamic element selection based on runtime context
