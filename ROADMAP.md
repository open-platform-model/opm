- [x] Component and module definitions
- [x] Three-layer architecture (ModuleDefinition ‚Üí Module ‚Üí ModuleRelease)

  - [x] Sample modules for testing (`tests/fixtures/data.cue`)
  - [x] Test runner (`tests/test_tool.cue` - `cue cmd test`)
  - [x] Test documentation (`tests/README.md` - comprehensive guide)

**Current Status**: ~50 test cases across ~3,100 lines of test code covering core OPM logic. Test runner working (`cue cmd test`). CI/CD integration pending.

**Critical Gaps** (Immediate Priority):

- **Provider/transformer selection tests** (`unit/provider.cue` - ~2-4 hours effort)
  - Transformer selection based on component element composition
  - Provider capability matching
  - `#SelectTransformer` logic validation
  - Provider context construction
- **Comprehensive negative test cases** (~4-8 hours effort)
  - Invalid component configurations (multiple workload types)
  - Conflicting element combinations
  - Required field violations
  - Invalid value overrides breaking constraints
- **Edge case coverage** (~4-8 hours effort)
  - Empty components/modules
  - Deeply nested value references
  - Large-scale modules (50+ components)
  - Unicode in names/labels
  - Boundary values (max port numbers, etc.)

**Known Limitations** (CUE Test Framework):

- No test isolation (shared namespace)
- Limited error messages (cryptic CUE unification errors)
- No test discovery (explicit paths required)
- No mocking capabilities
- No assertions library
- No test output formatting
- No parallel execution
- Cannot test I/O operations, time-dependent behavior, or external integrations

**Future Enhancements** (3-Phase Evolution):

**Phase 1: Complete CUE Framework** (~16-20 hours)

- Add provider/transformer tests
- Expand negative test cases
- Add edge case coverage
- Improve test documentation and inline comments

**Phase 2: Enhanced CUE Tooling** (~40-60 hours)

- Test helpers and utilities
- Better error reporting (parse CUE errors for readability)
- Test organization (tags/categories, selective execution)
- Performance metrics tracking

**Phase 3: Go Test Suite** (~80-120 hours)

- CLI testing framework (command execution, flag parsing, exit codes)
- Integration test harness (K8s test clusters, mock services, end-to-end workflows)
- Performance testing (benchmarks, load testing, memory profiling)
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, automated workflows)

**Exit Criteria**: All elements, modules, and transformers have automated tests running in CI, with complementary Go tests for CLI and runtime behavior

**Phase 1 Overall Exit Criteria**: Deploy a complete application to Kubernetes using OPM with native resources, operator-managed resources, type-safe validation, and comprehensive automated testing

## Research & Open Questions

Areas we're actively exploring:

### Workflow Strategy

- Should OPM define its own pipeline system or standardize integration with existing CI/CD tools?
- Should there be separate standards for CI/CD pipelines vs. application lifecycle operations?

### Dependency Management

- How to handle element dependencies across modules?
- Strategy for deprecating elements while maintaining backward compatibility
- Versioning strategy for elements vs. modules

### Platform Integration

- Design for runtime queries to pull environment-specific metadata
- How should platform teams curate and enforce module catalogs?
- Integration patterns with service meshes, observability platforms

### Element Evolution

- How to add new elements when the project is in wide use?
- Migration paths for breaking changes

### Element Discovery & Filtering

- Label-based element filtering and query system
- Element discovery by category, platform, maturity, compliance requirements
- Dynamic element selection based on runtime context
