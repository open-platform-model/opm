## Overview

The trait system for OPM is now defined in the **Trait Definition Specification**, which provides a detailed breakdown of authoring, validating, and publishing traits.

Key features of the new specification:

- **#Trait Definition**: Detailed schema for authoring traits.
- **Applicability Rules**: Strict `appliesTo` whitelist enforcement.
- **Publishing**: Use `cue mod publish <version>` to push trait definitions.

For the complete specification including schemas, requirements, and examples, refer to the [Trait Definition Specification](../../005-definition-trait/spec.md).
